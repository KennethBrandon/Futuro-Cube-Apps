### Original Readme:
This example shows simple implementation of rubik's cube with animated rotations.
Direction of rotation is determined by inclination of tapped side. SolveDir function
reads accelerometer data and compares with threshold for direction.  
Also each move is stored into variable, so the progress is never lost.
