### Disclamer : This app was never finished.

This was an attempt at making a Rubik's Cube that encourages you as you solve the cube.  The idea is to have a flashing encouragment with a sound at the compleation of every step of solving.

### Encouragment at:
* Cross
* F2L Pairs
* OLL
* Solve

### Todo:
* Add Scrambling
* Optimize code
* Save High Score

### Original Readme:
This example shows simple implementation of rubik's cube with animated rotations.
Direction of rotation is determined by inclination of tapped side. SolveDir function
reads accelerometer data and compares with threshold for direction.  
Also each move is stored into variable, so the progress is never lost.
